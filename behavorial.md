# Career Transitions
Think about the career transitions you’ve made so far. Write about recent ones: what motivated them, what you felt like went well, and what could have gone better.

Reminiz -> RealEyes
- Motivation: Very small company, CTO left before me and he was pushing us to do high quality work, this changed after his departure
    - Moved on to retrieve a stimulating environment
- Went well: I spent 2 weeks in Hungary to meet the whole team, I was able to understand how they worked.
- What could have gone better? Being more mindful about the forces at play in the team (Seniors influence, history of company...)

RealEyes -> Snapchat / Why Snapchat?
- Motivation:
    - large company => impact millions of people,
    - resources to grow,
    - fancy & creative products (1st on stories, filters)
    - Very nice contact with Snap recruiters at NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver => nice atmosphere
- How to make my arrival a success?
    - Spend enough time understanding the work and getting to know the team and its skillset
    - Understand key challenges and roadmap of the team
    - Get involved ASAP to get a practical onboarding

# Why me?
- Experience with CV/DL + research
- Autonomous, rigorous
- Experience of small companies
    - I learnt what happens when we cut corners / why things are needed
- Passionate about AI / CV

- Qualities: autonomous, rigorous, fast-learner, passionate
- Defaults: I have a hard time giving up, tendency to avoid conflicts, idealistic

# Growth at $COMPANY$
Write about what working at $COMPANY$ would help you become in the coming years.
- Learn about larger scale systems
- Access resources and experts to learn
- Learn about large companies
Me in the coming years: more seniority => more expertise, capacity to design stable systems and onboard juniors

# Interesting Projects
Consider projects you’ve undertaken - especially the largest, most difficult, most successful, least successful, etc. Write descriptions of these.

Google: 2 years long tech validation (300k$ + 300k$)
Lead of the project + weekly calls with Google for me to share our progress and struggles
Permanent communication with 2 founders of RealEyes: CTO & CPO
(+) I was hiring to replace people who just left

- Defined requirements with Google
- Difficult: After start, people left => low resources, same schedule => work under pressure for 6 months

- Least successful: [Presence prediction + segmentation of data] 1st phase late by 2 months
    - I led the team through hard times: low resources + pressure + people already left, and everybody stayed.
    - I managed to get us to deliver: new annotation tool + new model + new data pipelines + 6k videos dataset + annotations
        - No new departures in the team
- Most successful: 2nd phase - 300k$
    - Situation: 6 months to plan, more stable resources, eye contact with the screen - on mobile
    - Task: planning, reassure strained team that pace will be saner (PTSD from 1st phase), focus on planning interesting work for the team (empathy)
    - Approach: full planning, mapped all steps, more margin in the plans, focus on data quality for trust, focus on low risk approach + iterations
    - Results: I maintained good morale and motivation in the team, my plans were followed and we delivered in time

# Taking Initiative
Write about how you’ve taken the initiative on teams you’ve been a part of. Where have you gone beyond what was expected?
- Realeyes:
    - joining -> better experiment reporting: presentation + set up
    - Set up mandatory QC: design workflow with DE, set up code, automate => data trust++++
- Reminiz:
    - Annotation tool was buggy => redesigned UX (integrated ML in it), managed 1 FE developer => 5x speed-up, 60% less mistakes

# Work Relationships
Write about the managers and coworkers who’ve impacted you the most. Consider also the most difficult work relationships you’ve encountered.
- CTO @Reminiz:
    - "Warm atmosphere, serious work"
        - Challenge: team was only juniors, so I had to learn by myself and share learnings, be autonomous
        - I kept pushing everybody to do better, e.g. TIL during stand-up
    - "improve your setup / work environment"
        - I keep learning, I fix issues as they happen and do not wait for them to slow me down
- CEO @Moodstocks:
    - Fresh out of school => helped me with transition to work life: "0 grade but responsibilities"
        - "We need to be able to trust you and your work"
        - I always make sure thay my work is correct and clear.
        - I communicate early, challenge assumptions
    - "no bullshit", "no jargon" => be cristal clear, make sure everybody understands what I explain

- Senior @Realeyes: resistance to change, high confidence in false things
    - I verify claims, then bring proof if they are wrong
    - I avoid confrontation, give opportunity to correct himself by using private messages


# Team Roles
Write about what roles you’ve played on recent teams you’ve been a part of. How did you end up playing those roles? What has worked out well and what hasn’t been the best fit?
- Team lead
    - I organized the plans, set up roadmap with the team. Make sure every topic is covered
    - good: I like organizing, team was needing plans and happy that I pushed for it
    - bad:
        - History of higher ups changing plans => I had to educate team that we plan with capacity in mind
            - => changes mean exchanging plans not adding
        - not an official title => I learnt to convince people, and seek consensus

- Recruiter
    - From June 2020 => interviews for senior roles
    - good: I gathered info from people about how to handle interviews, set up a hiring document.
        - Hired 1 researcher, I found 1 senior PM who should join in the coming months
    - bad: No training, right into it ALONE => Pushed me to learn by myself / autonomous
- Data Engineer
    - Google project, Senior DE left
    - good: I managed to clean a lot of misleading code => team has more trust in tools
    - bad: No one to tell us about the basics of DE at the time => not best design => NOW I KNOW

# Adaptability & coachability
- Working as a team
    - Make sure team info is shared, understood, ideally readable somewhere
- Ability to receive feedback
    - I always ask for feedback, really willing to learn
- Adapting to change and adversity
    - Always welcome change PROPOSAL, make sure that cost is worth the reward, make sure this is the right battle
        - **Define success**
    - Adversity: plan without pressure in mind => then only, you can decide on corners to cut
        - Planning directly with cut corners leads to missed information => premature decisions

# Relationship building skills
- Building & leveraging relationships
    - 1 on 1s with the team
    - I always reach out personally to team members who look demotivated during the stand-up.
        - Ex: Maksim with Ivan
    - 2 years of communication with Google internal teams
    - Helped head of DS by fixing 1 DS' ML direction
- Handling conflict
    - Internal:
        1. make sure everyone understands each other
        2. Seek consensus, if impossible, find trade-off. Let ego aside
    - External:
        1. Clarify situation, guess actual needs with customers
        2. With other colleagues, estimate cost & rewards (warning: opportunity cost)
        3. Get back to customer, explain plans, offer something => ask empowered customer to choose
