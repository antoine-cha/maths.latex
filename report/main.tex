\chapter{Statistics}
\section{Random sample}
A random sample is a collection of $n$ random variables $X_1,\dots, X_n$ that are independent and
identically distributed with $X$.

\section{Bias}
The bias of an estimator $\hat{\theta}$ of a parameter $\theta$ is
\begin{align*}
    Bias(\hat{\theta}) = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta
\end{align*}
An estimator is said unbiased if $Bias(\hat{\theta}) = 0$ .

\section{Mean}
The mean is $\mu = E[X]$ . \\
The sample mean is $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i}$ . \\
It is unbiased, i.e. $E[\bar{X}] = \mu$ .
\subsection{Central limit theorem}
Let us have a random sample $X_1,\dots, X_n$ following a mean $\mu$ and a variance $\sigma^2$, then we have
\begin{align*}
    &\bar{X} \underset{n \to +\infty}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})
\end{align*}

\section{Variance}
The variance is $Var[X] = E[(X - \bar{X})^2]$. \\
The sample variance is $s^2 = \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(X_i - \bar{X})^2}$ \\
It is unbiased, i.e. $E[\hat{\sigma}^2] = \sigma^2$.

\subsection{Chi-squared relation with sample variance}
Let $s^2$ be the sample variance,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{s^2(n-1)}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi_{n-1}^2
\end{align*}

\section{Confidence interval}
A confidence interval $CI_{1-\alpha}$ with confidence level $1-\alpha$ of a true parameter $\theta$
such that
\begin{align*}
    P(\theta \in CI_{1-\alpha}) = 1 - \alpha
\end{align*}

\section{Hypothesis testing}
Let $T$ be the test statistics and $R$ the rejection region.
A test statistic is a statistic (a quantity derived from the sample) used in statistical hypothesis testing.
A hypothesis test is typically specified in terms of a test statistic, considered as a numerical summary
of a dataset that reduces the data to one value that can be used to perform the hypothesis test

\subsection{Type I error}
The type I error, often noted $\alpha$, also called "false alarm" or significance level is the probability
of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.
\begin{align*}
    \alpha = P(T \in R\; |\; H_0\; true)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Type II error}
The type II error, often noted $\beta$ also called "missed alarm" is the probability
of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.
\begin{align*}
    \alpha = P(T \notin R\; |\; H_0\; false)
\end{align*}

\subsection{p-value}
The $p$-value is the probability under the null hypothesis of a having a test statistic $T$ at
least as extreme as the one that we observed $T_0$:
\begin{align*}
    \text{(left-sided)} \quad & \text{p-value} = P(T \leq T_0\; |\; H_0\; true) \\
    \text{(right-sided)}\quad & \text{p-value} = P(T \geq T_0\; |\; H_0\; true) \\
    \text{(two-sided)}  \quad & \text{p-value} = P(|T| \geq |T_0|\; |\; H_0\; true) \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Non-parametric test}
A non-parametric test is a test where we do not have any underlying assumption regarding the
distribution of the sample.

\section{Estimation}
The observed data is $D = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$ . \\
The posterior is $P(\theta\, | \, D)$ . \\
The prior is $P(\theta)$ . \\
The likelihood is $P(D\; |\; \theta)$ . \\
Using Bayes rule $P(\theta | D) = \frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}$,
so $P(\theta | D) \propto P(D|\theta)P(\theta)$ .

\subsubsection{Maximum likelhood estimation (MLE)}
 The maximum likelihood estimation chooses $\theta$ that maximimizes the probability of observed data:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{\theta}_{MLE} = arg\,\underset{\theta}{max}\; P(D\,|\, \theta)
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP)}
The MAP estimation chooses $\theta$ that is most probable given observed data $D$ and prior belief
$P(\theta)$. \\

\begin{align*}
    \hat{\theta}_{MAP} & = arg\,\underset{\theta}{max}\; P(\theta | D) \\
                       & = arg\,\underset{\theta}{max}\; P(D | \theta) P(\theta) \\
\end{align*}

\chapter{ML design}

\section{Principles}
\subsection{Characteristics of ML systems}
There are key differences between Machine Learning during the training phase and during the prediction phase.
By design, these 2 phases will face different challenges. So the systems will be designed very differently.
\textbf{But code should be shared between the 2 phases to avoid model misuse.}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|}
        \hline
        Phase & Key aspects \\
        \hline
        Training & Offline, model agnostic, iteration speed \\
        \hline
        Prediction & Real-time, production systems, scale, observability \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{center}

\section{Challenges}
This section is a summary of \cite{tech-debt}.

\subsection{Complex models erode boundaries}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|p{10cm}|}
        \hline
        Challenge & Defintion \\
        \hline
        \hline
        Entanglement & ML systems mix signals together. Isolated improvements are impossible. \\
                     & CACE: Changing Anything Changes Everything \\
        \hline
        Correction Cascade & When chaining models, we create dependencies (e.g. multiple heads). \\
                           & This can create an improvement deadlock: improving any component leads to
                           system-level detriments. \\
        \hline
        Undeclared consumers & Creates hidden tight coupling of model to other parts of the stack.
            Changes to the model will impact other parts of the stack in unintended ways.
            This increases the cost and difficulty of making any changes to the model. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Data dependencies cost more than code dependencies}

\subsubsection{Unstable data dependencies}
 Input signal may not be stable: output of other ML model that could
be updated, data-dependent look-up table. Also, owner of the input signal may decide to change
it. To mitigate, create a versioned copy of the input signal, e.g. freeze the input mapping, model
and use it until all consumers have upgraded to the new input. \\

\subsubsection{Underutilized data dependencies}
These are input signals that provide very little value
but by using them, the model is vulnerable to their change, whereas they could be remove
without detriment
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|p{10cm}|}
        \hline
        Features type & Defintion \\
        \hline
        \hline
        Legacy features & Feature is included early in development, but is later made redundant. \\
        \hline
        Bundled features & A group of features is evaluated and found to be benefitial. All features
            are included without verifying if they are all relevant. \\
        \hline
        $\epsilon$-features & Feature that adds very little improvement (i.e. benchmark hacking) \\
        \hline
        Correlated features & 2 features are strongly correlated, but ML model won't understand it.
            This results in brittleness if the correlation later changes.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Underutilized features can be detected via exhaustive leave-one-feature-out evaluations. These should
be run regularly to identify and remove unnecessary features.

\subsection{Feedback loops}
\subsubsection{Direct feedback loop}
A model may directly influence the selection of its own future training data.

\subsubsection{Hidden feedback loop}
When 2 systems influence each other indirectly. E.g. 2 models defining the items to show in a Web
page. Changing one model will change the user's behaviour, which is most likely one input signal
to the 2nd model. \\
Other example, competing models on the stock market. Any modification of one model will change the
behaviour of the competing models as a consequence. Note that the introduced modification could be
a bug.

\subsection{ML-system anti-patterns}
\subsubsection{Glue code}
95\% of the code in a mature ML system is glue code, 5\% is machine learning code. Glue code is costly
in the long term because it tends to freeze a system to the peculiarities of a specific package. Testing
alternatives may become prohibitively expensive. \\
A common strategy for combating glue code is to wrap black-box packages into common APIs.

\subsubsection{Pipeline jungles}
Often appears in data preparation, these can evolve organically, as new signals are identified and new
sources added incrementally. Without care, the system may become a jungle of scrapes, joins and sampling steps
, often with intermediate files output. Detecting errors and recovering from failures will be difficult
and costly, \\
Avoid by thinking holistically baout data collection and features extraction. Scraping and redesigning
a pipeline jungle is a major investment, but it can dramatically reduce ongoing costs and speed further
innovation.

\subsubsection{Dead experimental codepaths}
As a consequence of glue code and pipeline jungles, it becomes attractive in the short term to
experiment alternative methods by implementing experimental codepaths as conditional branches within
the main production code. Over time, these accumulated paths create a growing debt due to the increasing
difficulty of maintaining backward compatibility and exponential cyclomatic complexity.\\
Avoid by periodically re-examining the experimental branch and remove the unused ones.

\subsubsection{Abstraction debt}
Due to a lack of strong abstractions in ML, it is too easy to blur the line between the components.

\subsubsection{Common smells}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|p{10cm}|}
        \hline
        Smell & Definition \\
        \hline
        \hline
        Plain-old-data type smell& ML outputs do not come with metadata to explain their nature.
            E.g.: is that p(x) or 1-p(x)? Is this a log?  \\
        \hline
        Multiple-language smell & Using multiple languages increases the cost of effective testing
            and increases difficulty of transferring ownership to other individuals.\\
        \hline
        Prototype smell & The project relies on a protoyping environment. Full-scale system may be
            brittle, difficult to change. In times of pressure, this prototyping environment will be
            pushed to production. What's more, results at small scale rarely reflect reality at
            full scale.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Fighting configuration debt}
ML systems come with many parameters that can be configured. Input signals may be changed, composed
out of many input signals that may also change, or be disabled. As a result, signals are created from
complex rules that are hard to track. \\
To limit configuration debt, follow these principles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It should be easy to specify a configuration as a small change from a previous configuration.
    \item It should be hard to make manual errors, omissions or oversights.
    \item It should be easy to see, visually, the difference in configuration between 2 models.
    \item It should be easy to automatically assert and verify basic facts about the configuration:
        number of features used, transitive closure of data dependencies, ...
    \item Configurations should undergo a full code review and be checked into a repository.
\end{itemize}




\chapter{Transformers}
There is a theory which states that if ever anyonek discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
\subsection{Definition}
\begin{align*}
    Let &\\
        &X \in \mathbb{R}^d, \\
        &Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model}} \\
        &W_K, W_Q, W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{model}} \\
        &q = W_Q X, \quad k = W_K X, \quad v = W_V X \\
        &Y = softmax(\frac{qk^T}{\sqrt{d}})v \label{eq:transformer} \tag{1}
\end{align*}


\section{Gradients}
Let's compute the gradients analytically to understand how they will flow through a model when
transformers blocks are stacked in a deep neural network.
We will start from the formulas in \eqref{eq:transformer}
